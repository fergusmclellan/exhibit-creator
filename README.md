# exhibit-creator
Tkinter based application to simplify

1) Exhibit creation from code - checks that final image size will be < 950*600 pixels
Creates image with consistent font and size, with a 2 pixel border around image.

2) Drag and Drop creation from code - allows text to be selected, and converted into
individual images which can be dragged and dropped onto the main exhibit. Ensures that
main exhibit and the total option size is < 950*760 pixels, and uses consistent
font and size, and spacing around option images.
